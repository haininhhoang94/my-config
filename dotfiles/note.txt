Here's how you can set up 2 windows to scroll together:

:vsplit to have two windows showing the same buffer. They start with the same viewport.
:set scrollbind in the current window
Switch to the other window. Adjust it to display the next "page" of text.
L to move the cursor to the bottom of the second window
zt to scroll the buffer so the cursor's line is at the top of the window. Now the last line in the first window is the first line in the second window.
Ctrl+e to scroll the buffer up one line, so each window is now displaying their own distinct, but continuous views of the buffer.
:set scrollbind so the second window scrolls along with the first window
You can repeat these steps for any other windows you want to be part of the same bound group of windows.
